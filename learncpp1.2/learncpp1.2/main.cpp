#include <iostream>
// this program tests the direct list initialization which should be preferred
// according to the tutorial
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
//    direct list initialization of multiple variables separated with a comma
    int a{5}, b{3};
    a = 7;
    // printing an expression and then a newline, would be cool to find a way to do both together!
    printf("hello!");
    std::cout << a;
    return 0;
} // i should just focus on working and that's it man!
