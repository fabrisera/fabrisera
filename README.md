# Math 152 Spring 2020 Computational Problems Fabrizio Serafini
In this repository I will upload some of the Computational Exploratory problems for Math152, you are free to download 
and use them as long as you reference my name. If you are taking Math 152, please do not look at them as doing so would be
a violation of the Harvard Honor Code!
